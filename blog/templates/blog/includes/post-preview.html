            {% comment %} When referencing a source, we can use url if we want to dynamically look at the urls.py file (the first parameter is the path, which is a named path in this case, and the second argument is the slug/dynamic segment that the path is waiting for), and static if we want to look for any path inside the static folder. The add filter allow us to have a dynamic endpoint (recall that we first need to load the static attribute at the top of the page) {% endcomment %}
